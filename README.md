# Notion2Pelican

Import Notion Pages into a Pelican compatible folder structure and files

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For this to work you need the ID of your notion database and the key which are available
> from your notion dashboard

1. how to get the ID:
https://docs.tooljet.com/docs/data-sources/notion/#:~:text=Database%20ID%3A%20You'll%20find,ZZZ%20is%20the%20page%20ID.

2. how to get the secret:
https://docs.tooljet.com/docs/data-sources/notion/#:~:text=Database%20ID%3A%20You'll%20find,ZZZ%20is%20the%20page%20ID.

3. Select the page and grant access to the connection (to right ..., select Connections, Connect to, type the name of your integration).

## Examples

See the ./docs folder for minimalist code which imports a Notion DB into a pelican blogging and generates the static site.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The below example relies on the secrets to be in a local .env file (which containing secrets has to be created for each machine)
> with the following keys: `FT_dbid` the ID of your database `NOTIONKEY` which usually starts with `secret_` and is available from your 
> Notion dashboard

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Integrations have a scope of the workspace they are created for

> cd docs
> python example.py
